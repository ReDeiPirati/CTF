# SMALLEST MD5

I have lied that I have found the smallest MD5 hash possible, to win a bet.
Now the other guy is pissed off and wants to know where have I got this hash from. What results to this hash? Please help!

Ok, let's do a quick search on Google about MD5 minimum hash, and find [the record page for MD5 value](http://0xf.kr/md5/).

The min is obtained by the test: 08ni(g0u3ada_JiyongYoun-HLETRD, so the flag is:
ASIS{08ni(g0u3ada_JiyongYoun-HLETRD}
